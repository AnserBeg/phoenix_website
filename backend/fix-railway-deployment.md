# 🔧 Fix Railway Deployment Detection Issue

## Problem
Railway shows: "Railpack could not determine how to build the app"

## Root Cause
Railway is analyzing your entire repository instead of just the `backend` directory where your Python app is located.

## Solution 1: Correct Root Directory (Recommended)

1. **In Railway dashboard**, go to your project
2. **Click on your service** (backend)
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**
4. **Under "Source"**, change the root directory to `backend`
5. **Save changes** and redeploy

## Solution 2: Alternative Deployment Method

If Solution 1 doesn't work:

1. **Delete the current Railway project**
2. **Create a new project**
3. **Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select `phoenix_website` repository**
5. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Set root directory to `backend`** (not the entire repo)
6. **Click "Deploy Now"**

## Solution 3: Manual Service Configuration

If both above fail:

1. **Deploy the entire repository** first (any way it works)
2. **Go to your service settings**
3. **Change the root directory** to `backend`
4. **Redeploy the service**

## Verification Steps

After fixing, verify:
- ✅ Railway shows "Python" as the detected language
- ✅ Build process starts without errors
- ✅ Service deploys successfully
- ✅ API endpoint responds at `/api/`

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong**: Root directory = `/` (entire repo)
✅ **Correct**: Root directory = `backend`

❌ **Wrong**: Root directory = `frontend`
✅ **Correct**: Root directory = `backend`

## File Structure Check

Ensure your `backend` directory contains:
```
backend/
├── server.py          ← Main FastAPI app
├── requirements.txt   ← Python dependencies
├── railway.toml      ← Railway config
├── nixpacks.toml     ← Build config
└── Procfile          ← Alternative config
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all configuration files** are committed to Git
3. **Try Railway CLI** instead of UI deployment
4. **Contact Railway support** with your specific error

## Quick Test

Test if your backend is properly configured:
```bash
cd backend
python -c "import fastapi; print('FastAPI version:', fastapi.__version__)"
```

This should work without errors if your Python setup is correct.
